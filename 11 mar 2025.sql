-- for updating the table we use with check option , with check option local, with check option cascaded
-- when a view is built on top of another view, WITH CHECK OPTION works differently based on LOCAL or CASCADED.
-- LOCAL
-- Only the current view's WHERE condition is checked.
-- Does not check conditions of underlying views.
-- CASCADED (default behavior)

-- Checks this viewâ€™s WHERE condition.
-- Also checks the conditions of all underlying views.
